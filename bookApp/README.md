# "Book Manager": An iOS App <br />
<p align="center">
     This is an app that allows you to track your reading list from a pre-populated list of books. To help you decide which books to add to your list, youâ€™ll need to fetch the synopsis for each book from OpenLibrary with an API call. You can also add new books to the list, but you cannot edit them so far (this is a functionality coming soon).
