## Installation

You have two lists, a list of books and a reading list. When you tap on a book, you can see detail about that book: the book cover, title, author, and the synopsis fetched from OpenLibrary. There is also a button in the upper right corner. If the book is not on the reading list, it says “Add to List”. If the book is on the reading list, it says “Remove from List”. And, clearly, that button adds and removes books on the reading list. You can view the reading list by tapping on its tab button. The books on the reading list are not click-able, but you can swipe them to remove them from the reading list. We saw the swipre-to-delete functionality in lecture 8.
